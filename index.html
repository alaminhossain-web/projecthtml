            If you are passionate about learning new things, fascinated by
            computers, and enjoy problem-solving, you can become a computer
            genius. And don’t worry if you can’t pursue a computer science
            degree. You can build computer mastery by combining a solid
            understanding of computer fundamentals with hands-on experience,
            troubleshooting skills, and knowing how to find useful information.

            <strong>1. </strong> <br />
            Find (and read) a book for a beginner. Even if you are not brand new
            to using a computer, getting a book for beginners is a great way to
            fill the gaps in your knowledge. Ask your librarian to show you
            books for beginning computer users, search your favorite
            bookseller's website for “computers for beginners,” or try one of
            these: Any computer-related book in the “For Dummies” series, such
            as PCs for Dummies or Macs for Dummies. How Computers Work by Ron
            White Upgrading and Repairing PCs by Scott Mueller
          </p>

            <strong>2. </strong> <br />
            Learn the names of the hardware in your computer. To become a computer genius, you will need to understand how the different parts of a computer work with one another.
Everything inside of your computer is connected to the motherboard, including the CPU, which acts as the computer’s “brain.”
RAM stores data that’s currently in use. Become familiar with how it works with and connects to the motherboard.
Peripheral cards add functions to the computer. Learn about sound, networking, and video cards.
Storage and disk drives are places to store data. Research hard drives, CD/DVD-ROM drives, and removable media like USB flash drives and SD cards.
